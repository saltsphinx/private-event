1    A site for pet-sitting (watching someone’s pet while they’re gone).
    People can babysit for multiple pets and pets can have multiple petsitters.

2    You like hosting people for dinner so you want to build
    a dinner party invitation site. A user can create parties, invite people to
    a party, and accept an invitation to someone else’s party.

3    Extra credit (tricky): You and your friends just love posting things and
    following each other. How would you set up the models so a user can follow
    another user?
